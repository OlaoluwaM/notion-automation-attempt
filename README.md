# Description

This project was my attempt in using puppeteer to try to automate notion, before their API went into public beta ofc.
The goal was to scrape my completed todos for the week then use the data to create a dashboard I could use as a personal productivity reference.
I succeeded in scraping the notion.so site where my pages were hosted but quickly found that the data was insufficient and that was how this project died. You can pay your respects!

At least now we have a Notion API!!!!!
